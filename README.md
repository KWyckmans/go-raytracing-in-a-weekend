# Raytracer in a weekend using Golang

Wanting to learn go for a long time, but being bored of standard tutorials, I decided to follow [Ray Tracing in a Weekend](https://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf) after seeing one of the many threads about it on [Hacker News](news.ycombinator.com). While I am happy to share the results, beware that this is one of my first go programs and as such the code may not be idiomatic and may contain things that look weird. Feel free to comment where code could be improved.

## Instructions

Running `go run .\main.go` outputs a `.ppm` file that you can open in your preferred imageviewer. I used Irfanview on Windows 10 for testing.
